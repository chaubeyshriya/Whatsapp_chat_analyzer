**About the Project**
With the increasing use of messaging apps like WhatsApp, there's a need for tools that help users derive meaningful insights from their conversations. This project, developed as part of our Artificial Intelligence Lab coursework at KIIT, addresses that by allowing users to upload chat exports and analyze patterns using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.

It works for both individual and group chats, and allows you to select a specific user for targeted analysis.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Text Processing: Regular Expressions, WordCloud, Emoji Analysis
Libraries: urlextract, wordcloud, emoji, seaborn
